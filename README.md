# YATRAWISE
YatraWise is a cybersecure smart tourism and women safety platform that helps travelers stay safe using AI-based risk detection, scam alerts, and emergency features. It provides a smart safety map, SOS system, privacy dashboard, and admin monitoring to predict danger and protect users in real time
How we built it

We built YatraWise using React.js for the frontend and Firebase for backend, authentication, and database. Google Maps API was used to display safe and unsafe zones, while Chart.js helped create an interactive admin dashboard. We also implemented encrypted storage, role-based login, and demo datasets for safety alerts.
